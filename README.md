Endpoints Day 2
Create four endpoints; Odd or Even, Madlibs, Reverse num, and Reverse String

Peer Review by :  Zahid Afsar
Peer Comment : Your Code functions well when tested on both swagger and postman. One suggestion I have is to name your strings better in the madlib. It is hard to tell what should I type without going to the code and checking the story. Other than that everything else was great and overall I would like to say that you did a good job.
